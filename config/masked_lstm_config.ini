; Purpose:
; This init file is meant for unifying the parameters used for the 
; sliding window computations (finding ideal window size for each feature)
; and then using these ideal window sizes to put into a LSTM with a given masking
; This should contain train/test split factor, input size, hidden layer size, 
; etc.
